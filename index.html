        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <img src="images/selfie.jpg" alt="Picture of Kelly with Earbuds"  title="A picture of me!" class="float responsive-img">
          <p>My first foray into making websites was in elementary school in Microsoft Publisher about things I was passionate about, including my own stories. However, my first real experience with code (more specifically, HTML), was in middle school when I took over my mom's website and dedicated it to shows and books I absolutely loved.</p>

          <p>I have gradually dived deeper over the years into web development for personal &amp; business reasons, with the deepest plunges being on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>: completing their <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development" target="_blank">front-end web developer track</a>, which has helped me fine-tune my skills and gain confidence in my abilities, and enrolling in their <a href="https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/" target="_blank">web development techdegree program</a>.</p>

          <p>I have worked in retail for the past 10 years or so and I have decided I want a career change. I want something that will better utilize my skill set and provide me with interesting challenges I am more than willing to take on. For me, web development is that career change.</p>

          <p>Outside of retail and learning more web development, I do <a href="https://www.trainerkelly.net" target="_blank">TrainerKelly's Network</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hurricane500000" target="_blank">Hurricane500000</a>. You can read more about them on the <a href="other.html" target="_blank">Other Project's</a> page.</p>

          <p>When I'm not working on anything, I enjoy reading, binge-watching TV shows, playing video games (both alone and with my husband), and dancing a silly synchronized dance from Japan called <a href="https://parapara.dance/" target="_blank">parapara</a> (as well as the variation, techpara).</p> 

          <p>I have a passion for anime, manga, and vegan food.</p>

          <p>My preferred pronouns are they/their, although I'll really accept any. He, she, it, they, ze, xie, whatever. I exist. That's all that really matters, right?</p>
