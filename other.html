            <p>If you have ever been curious about what someone does outside of work or what other motivations people have to hone their skills, this page would be the answer for me. </p>

            <p>This page contains projects that do not feel appropiate to place in my portfolio, but still provide real-world examples of my skill set.</p>

            <p>My other projects range from personal projects to business projects or a fusion of the two. My two most prominent projects, as I have mentioned on the <a href="index.html">homepage</a>, are <a href="#tkn">TrainerKelly's Network</a> and <a href="#h500k">Hurricane500000</a>.</p>

          <h2>TrainerKelly's Network</h2>
            <img src="images/tkn_logo.jpg" alt="TrainerKelly's Network Homepage" title="TrainerKelly's Network Logo and Mascot, all by me" class="float responsive-img">
                <p>This is what I do: <a href="https://www.trainerkelly.net" target="_blank">TrainerKelly's Network.</a></p>

                <p>The best way to describe TrainerKelly's Network is an upcoming online archive of my original works with a business model.</p>

                <p>I really love to tell stories &amp; draw pictures and share them with people. However, I haven't really had a centralized platform that allowed me full control. For me, I want TrainerKelly's Network to be that platform: a website people can go on and view my works, all in one place.</p>

                <p>I like to think TrainerKelly's Network is the final evolution of those websites I used to make in Microsoft Publisher back in elementary school and the mishmash-of-fandom websites in Microsoft Frontpage and Adobe Dreamweaver from middle school &amp; high school. Even after coming up with the name, I still had difficulty describing the concept until recently.</p>
                
                <p>TrainerKelly's Network is one of the reasons why I'm pursuing web development. If you're concerned that I might stop learning at some point, don't be: I have reasons to keep going beyond a job or a career. This is one of them.</p>

                    This comic was the reason I quickly learned how to make responsive websites. It was a daunting task, but I managed to get through it!<br /> <br />

                    The comic itself is currently on hiatus.

He is a video game channel where he films Let's Plays – video game walkthroughs with entertaining commentary – and utilizes his voice acting skills to add an extra flare to his content. As of March 2020, he has over 3,600 subscribers. </p>

              <p>I am mostly in charge of helping him make business decisions for his channel and creating illustrations for his use in videos and channel graphics. I am the illustrator (or artist, if that's what you want to call me) between the two of us. I also have created some graphics for him, including his most recent logo.</p>

              <p>Besides from business decisions and illustrations, I also occassionally provide voices and commentary in his videos.</p>
